# Carter API - Carter Tkinter Implementation

This program is an extract from an older version of my own personal smart-home AI system, which has been modified for this use case.

This program allows you to create an app which communicates with your Carter agent.

## How to Install

1. I have created an installer program which you'll need to run before anything else, to ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. SanwareAutoInstaller.py

2. You will need your Carter agent token and agent name to then insert into the ai_config.py file.

3. After that, enjoy using your own Jarvis (or whatever name you've chosen) in Tkinter!

Sanware MIT License, feel free to do whatever you want with this. It's a simple program, Carter is created by Huw Prosser at CarterLabs! https://www.carterlabs.ai/
