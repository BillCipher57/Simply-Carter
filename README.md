# Sanware Carter MK 0.1

This program is an extract from an older version of my own personal smart-home AI system, which has been modified for this use case.

This program allows you to create an app which communicates with your Carter agent.
This repo also includes an alternative interface which allows you to connect a Discord bot to your Carter agent, with extra features added from version 1.
An intent classification example will be added soon, which will form a self-learning offline algorithm which learns from Carter's responses.

## How to Install

1. I have created an installer program which you'll need to run before anything else, to ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. SanwareAutoInstaller.py

2. You will need your Carter agent token and agent name to then insert into the ai_config.py file.

3. After that, enjoy using your own Jarvis (or whatever name you've chosen) in Tkinter, Discord, or Command line!
